EASA 2021 Database has been released! We strongly recommend checking with your flight school or CAA and find out which database is used for your official exam. EASA has removed a lot of questions for creating the new database but they have also added new chapters. There will be added more new questions, so the difference in question numbers will not be so big. New questions have been added to the new syllabus after receiving students feedback.
